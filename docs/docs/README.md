# Quick start

ðŸ“š `figma-plugin-ds-vue` is a Vue component library that matches the Figma Design System for building Figma plugins. The library contains a set of handcrafted Vue components such as icons, buttons and other form elements that make it easy to create a plugin frontend that blends seamlessly into the Figma UI :sparkles::rainbow:

# Installation

1. Install the package `npm i figma-plugin-ds-vue`

2. Include the global stylesheet in your app (either on component-level or make it accessible globally by importing it to your app's entry file, ex: `main.js`)

```js
import 'figma-plugin-ds-vue/dist/figma-plugin-ds-vue.css'
```

3. Import and register the Vue components you want to use, refer to the [next chapter](/docs/components.html) for reference

4. Enjoy building your plugin :computer::sparkles:
