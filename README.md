`figma-plugin-ds-vue` is a Vue `v2.x` component library that matches the Figma Design System for building Figma plugins. The library contains a set of handcrafted Vue components such as icons, buttons and other form elements that make it easy to create a plugin frontend that blends seamlessly into the Figma UI ‚ú®üåà

This project is based on [@Thomas Lowrys](https://github.com/thomas-lowry) [figma-plugin-ds-svelte package](https://github.com/thomas-lowry/figma-plugin-ds-svelte) and can be seen as a fork of his svelte library.

## ‚ú® Installation

1.  Install the package `npm i figma-plugin-ds-vue`

2.  Include the global stylesheet in your app (either on component-level or make it accessible globally by importing it to your app's entry file, ex: `main.js`)

    `import 'figma-plugin-ds-vue/dist/figma-plugin-ds-vue.css'`

3.  Import and register the Vue components you want to use, refer to the [documentation](https://figma-plugin-ds-vue.netlify.app/) for details and an overview of all avaiable components

4.  Enjoy building your plugin üíª‚ú®

## üöß Roadmap

This project is a work-in-progress, here's a small roadmap:

‚¨ú `FigDisclosure` component should control its `FigDisclosureItem` child and prevent it from opening multiple disclosure menus at the same time  
‚¨ú Update documentation and create a meaningful order for the component overview (sorted alphabetically atm)  
‚¨ú Add detailed description of each component (context/usage?)  
...  
‚¨ú Update the library to Vue `v3.x` (since `v-model` changed with Vue 3 this would introduce breaking changes)

## üåÄ Misc

This project is based on [@Thomas Lowry's](https://github.com/thomas-lowry) [figma-plugin-ds-svelte package](https://github.com/thomas-lowry/figma-plugin-ds-svelte) and can be seen as a fork of his svelte library. It also includes refactored components of [@Morglod's](https://github.com/Morglod) [figma-vue-boilerplate](https://github.com/Morglod/figma-vue-boilerplate), a project which basically kickstarted the development of this one. S/o to these amazing humans üëã
